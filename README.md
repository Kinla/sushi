# Sushi
This is a sushi logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The application follows the MVC design pattern. It is deployed on Heroku.

### Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript/JQuery
* MySQL
* Node.js
* Express
* Handlebars

## How It Works
 * Type in your sushi offer to create a new sushi
 * Click on "Feed!" button to feed the cat
     * If you want to remove a sushi click the "x" button
 * The eaten sushi will be in gray on the right hand side
 * If the list gets too long a hidden option will appear on the bottom of the page. Try it!

## Improvements/Bugs
 * Responsive design
 * Add update option for undevoured sushi
 * Add count for devoured sushi
 * Add Menu Option for auto creation
 * Change the delete all devoured component to show based on number of devoured item
